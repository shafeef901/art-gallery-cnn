# art-gallery-cnn
An attempt to use CNN for solving the art gallery problem in Computational Geometry

We use ```CGAL``` for Computational geometry calculations and ```OpenGL``` for graphics.
The dataset can be generated using the general algorithm for vertex guards of the art gallery problem using **triangulation** and **K-coloring**.
Once dataset is ready, we train the CNN and can be further used to find the required guards to cover any new polygon.
